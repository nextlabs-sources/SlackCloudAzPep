            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="content-text">Ensuring that sensitive data stays secure is part of our mission. We at NextLabs respect your privacy and are committed
                to protecting any personal information you choose to share with us. This privacy statement explains when we might
                ask you for personal information, what we might do with it, and how we will protect its confidentiality.</p>
            
            <h2>When Do We Ask for Your Personal Information</h2>       
            <p class="content-text">Where we can, we let you browse our Web site without providing us with any personal information. However, to protect
                information about our products, our partners, and our customers, we do require that people login before accessing
                certain portions of our Web site. The information required for these limited-access portions are only used for specific
                purposes in order to enhance the service we provide to you. The use of such Web pages, and the information or programs
                downloadable from them, may be governed by a written agreement between your employer and NextLabs. Your personal
                information may be retained by NextLabs to verify compliance with the agreement, log software licenses granted, to
                track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.</p>
            <p class="content-text">We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you to provide a service
                or carry out a transaction that you have requested. Examples include: receiving information about NextLabs products
                and services, entering a contest, ordering e-mail newsletters, filling out a survey, downloading software or license
                keys, requesting additional information, applying to our Partner Program, logging into certain limited-access sections
                of our Web site (such as for support, partners, press), and signing up for an event or training. The personal information
                we collect may include your name, title, company or organization name, work e-mail, work phone, information about
                your job function, and information about your company. If you are applying for credit as part of our Partner Program,
                additional information about your company may be requested.</p>
            <p class="content-text">Our Web site may collect certain information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and
                the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the site;
                the pages that you access while at the site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly
                to our site. This information is used to help improve the site, analyze trends and administer the site.<br> From
                time to time, NextLabs may receive personal information from business partners and vendors. We only use such information
                if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Policy and applicable
                laws.</p>
            <h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Personal information collected by this Web site will be used to operate the Web site and to provide service(s) or carry
                out the transaction(s) that you have requested or authorized. We do not sell your personal information. We only share
                your personal data outside of NextLabs with your consent, as required by law, or to protect NextLabs, its customers
                and partners, or the public, or with companies that help NextLabs fulfill our obligations with you, and then only
                with business partners who share our commitment to protecting your privacy and data.</p>
            <p class="content-text">We may use your personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Web site and
                any related NextLabs products or services, and to make our Web site easier to use by eliminating the need for you
                to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Web site to your particular preference or interests.
                We may merge site-visitation data with anonymous demographic information for research purposes, and we may use this
                information in aggregate to provide more relevant content.</p>
            <p class="content-text">We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the products or services that
                you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you
                information about other NextLabs products and services, and/or share information with NextLabs partners so they may
                send you information about their products and services.</p>
            <p class="content-text">When you sign up for a newsletter or agree to receive promotional e-mail, we may use customized links or similar technologies
                to track e-mail links that you click. We may associate that information with your personal information in order to
                provide you more focused e-mail communications or purchase information. Each e-mail communication includes an unsubscribe
                link allowing you to stop delivery of that type of communication.</p>
            <p class="content-text">We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging,
                mailing and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information
                about our products, special offers, and other services. We will only provide those companies the personal information
                they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited
                from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
            <p class="content-text">NextLabs may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
                is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on NextLabs; (b) protect
                and defend the rights or property of NextLabs; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety
                of NextLabs employees or agents, users of NextLabs products or services, or members of the public.<br> Personal information
                collected on our web site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which NextLabs
                or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the web site, you consent to any such
                transfer of information outside of your country. NextLabs abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the
                U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
            <h2>Control of your Personal Information</h2>
            <p class="content-text">Except as otherwise described in this statement, we will not share personal information you provide to us without your
                permission. In addition, as described below, you may contact us at any time to update or delete your personal information.</p>
            <p class="content-text">On occasion, we may send you email informing you of technical service or security issues related to a product or service
                you requested or confirming you requested a product or service. In some services that may be offered by NextLabs,
                contacting you is an intrinsic part of the service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these mailings,
                as they are considered an essential part of the service(s) you have elected to receive.</p>
            <h2>Keeping Your Personal Information Secure</h2>
            <p class="content-text">We use a variety of physical, digital and managerial technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information
                from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, when we transmit sensitive personal information over the
                Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>
            <p class="content-text">While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit
                to us, and so we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change
                your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>
            <h2>Protection of Children’s Personal Information</h2>
            <p class="content-text">This Web site is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
            </p>
            <h2>Use of Cookies and Tracking Information</h2>
            <p class="content-text">A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your hard disk when you browse a Web site. When you visit our Web site,
                NextLabs may store a cookie on your computer’s hard drive. This allows us to enhance your ability to use our Web
                site by recognizing you when you visit or to optimize the information or features presented to you based on your
                demonstrated areas of interest. Cookies may also be used to compile aggregate information about areas of our site
                that are visited most frequently. This aggregate traffic information can be used to enhance the content of our site
                and make your experience more enjoyable.</p>
            <p class="content-text">You are always welcome to visit our Web site with cookies disabled. However, you made be asked to re-enter information
                that you have provided before (such as your name or contact information). In addition, certain capabilities of our
                Web site, such as use of limited-access portions, personalization or special interactivity features, may not function
                fully without cookies.</p>
            <p class="content-text">If you have requested information or services from us or have opted in to third-party mailing lists, you may receive
                email from us that references content that contains a unique identifier. Such content sometimes takes the form of
                tiny, transparent images that are sometimes called “clear GIFs” or an equivalent. These clear GIFs may be used to
                assist in delivering a cookie from our Web site. These cookies may be used to compile aggregated statistics about
                usage of our Web site, such as how many visitors clicked on key elements (such as links or graphics) on one of our
                Web pages, a blog or a newsletter. We may share aggregated site statistics with partner companies.</p>
            <p class="content-text">In addition, such clear GIFs may sometimes be used to deliver co-branded services. We may also include clear GIFs in
                promotional email messages, newsletters, and other communications in order to determine whether messages have been
                opened or acted upon. In some instances, clear GIFs may be placed by third-party service providers to help determine
                the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email communications. These clear GIFs may be used by such service
                providers to store a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the service provider to recognize your
                computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page
                views.</p>
            <h2>Partners and Agents</h2>
            <p class="content-text">As mentioned above, we may share certain information with trusted agents who provide specific services to us and/or
                administer information offered at our site, for example, service providers who help us manage, track and respond
                to customer inquiries, information requests, etc. We may also share information with our authorized resellers and
                integration partners, who may be better suited to respond directly to meet your specific NextLabs product and services
                needs. These parties do not use or otherwise disclose any information except as our authorized agents for the purpose
                of providing the products and services or administering the activities on our behalf. Any company that we share your
                personally identifiable information with will have executed a confidentiality agreement with us, requiring that they
                keep all data received from us confidential.</p>

                that all or substantially all of the assets of the company are acquired by a third party whether by merger, acquisition,
                reorganization or otherwise.</p>
            <h2>Third-Party Web sites</h2>
